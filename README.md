# KITT 2.0 Penetration Testing Framework

The KITT Penetration Testing Framework was developed as an open source solution for pentesters and programmers alike to compile the tools they use with what they know into an open source project.
With KITT, users are able to easily access a list of commonly used tools to their profession which are all open to configuration in the source code.
